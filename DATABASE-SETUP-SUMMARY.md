# Database Auto-Creation Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
Your MS SQL Server container was starting without automatically creating the required `SNP_WIP` database, causing connection errors for your SnApp application.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Initialization Script
**File:** `sql-scripts/init-database.sql`
- Creates the `SNP_WIP` database if it doesn't exist
- Uses conditional logic to avoid errors on restart
- Includes placeholder for additional tables/data if needed

### 2. Custom Container Entrypoint
**File:** `sql-scripts/entrypoint.sh`
- Starts SQL Server in background
- Waits for SQL Server to be ready
- Executes the database initialization script
- Keeps the container running

### 3. Updated Docker Compose Configuration
**Modified:** `docker-compose.yml`
- Added volume mounts for initialization scripts
- Set custom entrypoint for the SQL Server container
- Scripts are mounted as read-only for security

### 4. Database Testing Script
**File:** `test-database.sh`
- Verifies the database was created successfully
- Lists all available databases
- Provides troubleshooting information

### 5. Updated Documentation
**Modified:** `README.md`
- Added "Database Initialization" section
- Documented the automatic creation process
- Included testing instructions

## How It Works

1. **Container Startup:** When `docker-compose up` runs, the SQL Server container uses the custom entrypoint
2. **SQL Server Start:** The entrypoint starts SQL Server in the background
3. **Wait for Ready:** Script waits for SQL Server to accept connections
4. **Database Creation:** Executes the init script to create `SNP_WIP` database
5. **Ready for Use:** Your application can now connect to the database

## Benefits

- ✅ **Automatic:** Database is created on first container startup
- ✅ **Idempotent:** Safe to restart containers - won't create duplicates
- ✅ **No Manual Steps:** No need to manually create the database
- ✅ **Testable:** Includes verification script
- ✅ **Documented:** Clear instructions in README

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `sql-scripts/init-database.sql` - Database creation script
- `sql-scripts/entrypoint.sh` - Container initialization script
- `test-database.sh` - Database verification script
- `DATABASE-SETUP-SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### Modified Files:
- `docker-compose.yml` - Added volume mounts and custom entrypoint
- `README.md` - Added database initialization documentation

## Testing the Setup

After implementing these changes:

1. **Start the containers:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Test database creation:**
   ```bash
   ./test-database.sh
   ```

3. **Check container logs:**
   ```bash
   docker logs snapp-mssql
   ```

## Integration with Existing Workflow

This solution works seamlessly with your existing Jenkins pipeline:
- Jenkins still copies the `SNP-WIP.xml` configuration file during deployment
- The database is ready when the application tries to connect
- No changes needed to your Jenkins pipeline scripts

## Troubleshooting

If the database isn't created:
1. Check container logs: `docker logs snapp-mssql`
2. Verify script permissions: `ls -la sql-scripts/`
3. Run the test script: `./test-database.sh`
4. Check volume mounts in docker-compose.yml
